05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Your Task
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
You'll need to use the Day.js library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.
